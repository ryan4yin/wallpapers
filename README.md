# Wallpapers

All my wallpapers are in this folder. They are used by [ryan4yin/nix-config](https://github.com/ryan4yin/nix-config) to set the background.

Some special files are listed below:

1. `default_wallpaper`: the default wallpaper.
2. `wallpaper_random.py`: a script to randomly choose a wallpaper from this folder and set it as the background.
3. `convert_to_png.nu`: a Nushell script to convert all wallpapers to png format, not used now.
